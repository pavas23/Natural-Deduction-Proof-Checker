\item We start by finding the index of MT.
\item We check whether the rule is Modus Tollens or not by verifying that index of MT symbol is less than length of proof and store elements till index of MT symbol is reached in a string named {\ttfamily result}.
\item Then find the line number now in which premises for MT are present.
\item We now find the left and right parts of the implication statement.
\item Find index of slash in Implies statement and push the elements in stack in reverse order until the index of slash in Implies statement is found.
\item The Part before the \textquotesingle{}\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}\textquotesingle{} symbol is iterated while top element of stack is not \textquotesingle{}\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}\textquotesingle{}. If top element of stack is \textquotesingle{}(\textquotesingle{} then store them in the leftpart string and pop it out from stack until the top element becomes \textquotesingle{})\textquotesingle{}, else just add top element of stack to left string and then pop it from stack.
\item We also need to check for multiple brackets if left part contains multiple brackets and has \textquotesingle{}+\textquotesingle{} symbol before the actual \textquotesingle{}+\textquotesingle{} so we count the number of opening brackets.
\item Now we remove \textquotesingle{}\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}\textquotesingle{} symbol
\item And similar to the left part string, we add elements to right part string until stack is empty.
\item We now find the {\ttfamily $\sim$Ψ} give by line\+Number2 as implies statement is of the form {\ttfamily Φ\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}Ψ}.
\item We store new Negation of Right part in a string which stores the negation of right part we got from line\+Number 2 until the occurence of slash in negation of right part.
\item we add {\ttfamily \textquotesingle{}$\sim$\textquotesingle{}} to the right part string.
\item Now if right Part string after adding {\ttfamily $\sim$} symbol is same as the string corresponding to {\ttfamily line\+Number2} means premises are present then we add {\ttfamily $\sim$} to left\+Part and check whether it is equal to result given in proof string. ~\newline

In this algorithm we are traversing once over all the elements present in the string so time complexity will be {\ttfamily O(n)}. \end{quote}

As we are making stack of size n so space complexity will be {\ttfamily O(n)}. \end{quote}
