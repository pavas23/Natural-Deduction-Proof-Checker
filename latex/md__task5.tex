\item We start by finding the index of MT
\item We check whether the rule is Modus Tollens or not by verifying that index of MT symbol is less than length of proof and store elements till index of MT symbol is result string.
\item The find the line number now in which premises for MT are present
\item We now find the left and right parts of the implication statement
\item Find index of slash in Implies statement and push the elements in stack in reverse order until the index of slash in Implies statement we have found.
\item The Part before the \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} symbol is iterated while top element of stack is\textquotesingle{}nt \textquotesingle{}\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}\textquotesingle{}. If top element of stack is \textquotesingle{}(\textquotesingle{} then store them in the leftpart string and pop it out from stack until the top element becomes \textquotesingle{})\textquotesingle{}, else just add top element of stack to left string and then pop it from stack.
\item Now we remove \textquotesingle{}\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}\textquotesingle{} symbol
\item And similar to the left part string, we add elements to right part string.
\item We now find the $\sim$psi give by line\+Number 2
\item We store new Negation of Right part in a string which stores the negation of right part we got from line\+Number 2 until the occurence of slash is negation of right part.
\item we add \textquotesingle{}$\sim$\textquotesingle{} to the right part string and to left part string in new respective strings
\item If the string having new negation of right part and new negation of left part is exactly same as right part of string with added suffix of \textquotesingle{}$\sim$\textquotesingle{} and left part of string with added suffix of \textquotesingle{}$\sim$\textquotesingle{} respectively, then true is returned. If any of abv conditions fail, then false is returned.
