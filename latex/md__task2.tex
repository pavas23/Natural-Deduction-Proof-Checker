\item The statements in the proof are taken as inout which are to be verified for Conjnction(\+AND) Introduction
\item Make two different strings for left part occuring before \textquotesingle{}$^\wedge$\textquotesingle{} and right part occuring after \textquotesingle{}$^\wedge$\textquotesingle{}
\item Make stack for storing the proof of conjunction\+Introduction
\item Push the proof in reverse order in stack
\item The left\+Part is before the \textquotesingle{}+\textquotesingle{} symbol and is iterated while top element of stack is\textquotesingle{}nt \textquotesingle{}+\textquotesingle{}. If top element of stack is \textquotesingle{}(\textquotesingle{} then store them in the leftpart string and pop it out from stack until the top element becomes \textquotesingle{})\textquotesingle{}, else just add top element of stack to left string and then pop it from stack.
\item After this, we pop out \textquotesingle{}$^\wedge$\textquotesingle{} symbol
\item And now for the right part, pop out until stack is not empty
\item We now checke whether its i1 or i2
\item We now find the index where line numbers are present
\item As line1 and line2 are initially characters so we typecast to int and subtract 48 which is ascii value of 0
\item Now both left and right part should be present in premise
