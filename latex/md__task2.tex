\item The statements in the proof are taken as input which are to be verified for Disjunction(\+OR) Introduction
\item Make two different strings for left part occuring before \textquotesingle{}+\textquotesingle{} and right part occuring after \textquotesingle{}+\textquotesingle{}
\item Make stack for storing the proof of disjunction\+Introduction rule.
\item Push the proof line in reverse order in stack
\item The left\+Part is before the \textquotesingle{}+\textquotesingle{} symbol and is iterated while top element of stack is not \textquotesingle{}+\textquotesingle{}. If top element of stack is \textquotesingle{}(\textquotesingle{} then store them in the {\ttfamily leftpart} string and pop it out from stack until the top element becomes \textquotesingle{})\textquotesingle{}, else just add top element of stack to left string and then pop it from stack.
\item We also need to check for multiple brackets if left part contains multiple brackets and has \textquotesingle{}+\textquotesingle{} symbol before the actual \textquotesingle{}+\textquotesingle{} so we count the number of opening brackets.
\item After this, we pop out \textquotesingle{}+\textquotesingle{} symbol
\item And now for the right part string, pop out until stack is not empty
\item We now check whether it is i1 or i2 i.\+e \textquotesingle{}OR\textquotesingle{} introduction 1 or \textquotesingle{}OR\textquotesingle{} introduction 2.
\item We now find the index where line number is present
\item As the line number can contain more than one digit so we store it in a string named {\ttfamily stringline\+Number} and convert it to integer using {\ttfamily stoi} function.
\item Now if the type of disjunction introduction is 1 then left part should match with the proof line corresponding to the line number entered, else if it is type 2 then right part should match with the proof line corresponding to the line entered in the proof statement.
\item If the above thing matches then function returns true otherwise it will return boolean false. ~\newline

In this algorithm we are traversing once over all the elements present in the string so time complexity will be {\ttfamily O(n)}. \end{quote}

As we are making stack of size n so space complexity will be {\ttfamily O(n)}. \end{quote}
