\item The statements in the proof are taken as input which are to be verified for Conjunction(\+AND) Introduction
\item Make two different strings for left part occuring before \textquotesingle{}$^\wedge$\textquotesingle{} and right part occuring after \textquotesingle{}$^\wedge$\textquotesingle{}
\item Make stack for storing the proof line of conjunction\+Introduction
\item Push the proof in reverse order in stack
\item The left\+Part is before the $^\wedge$ symbol and is iterated while top element of stack is not \textquotesingle{}$^\wedge$\textquotesingle{}. If top element of stack is \textquotesingle{}(\textquotesingle{} then store them in the leftpart of string and pop it out from stack until the top element becomes \textquotesingle{})\textquotesingle{}, else just add top element of stack to left string and then pop it from stack.
\item We also need to check for multiple brackets if left part contains multiple brackets and has \textquotesingle{}$^\wedge$\textquotesingle{} symbol before the actual \textquotesingle{}$^\wedge$\textquotesingle{} so we count the number of opening brackets
\item After this, we pop out \textquotesingle{}$^\wedge$\textquotesingle{} symbol
\item And now for the right part,store the remaining elements of stack in right\+Part string and pop out until stack is not empty
\item We now need to find the index where line numbers are present
\item As the line numbers can be more than single digit also, so we store the first line number in a string named {\ttfamily stringline\+Number1} and other line number in a string named {\ttfamily stringline\+Number2}, as they both are in string data type we convert them to integer using {\ttfamily stoi} function.
\item Now both left and right part should be present in one of the proof\+Lines array.
\item If now the original left and right part is equal to the corresponding left and right string obtained then boolean true is returned, otherwise false ~\newline

In this algorithm we are traversing once over all the elements present in the string so time complexity will be {\ttfamily O(n)}. \end{quote}

As we are making stack of size n so space complexity will be {\ttfamily O(n)} \end{quote}
