\item The statements in the proof are taken as input which are to be verified for Implication Elimination
\item We initially find the index of slash and index of Implication symbol
\item We check whether the rule is implies elimination or not by verifying that index of implication symbol is less than length of proof and store elements in a string named {\ttfamily result} until slash is reached.
\item Follwing it, We find Line Numbers.
\item First line number is the implies statement in the above proof lines and second line number corresponds to the left Part in the implies statement.
\item As the line numbers can be more than single digit also, so we store the first line number in a string named {\ttfamily stringline\+Number1} and other line number in a string named {\ttfamily stringline\+Number2}, as they both are in string data type we convert them to integer using {\ttfamily stoi} function.
\item Find the left part and right part of the implies statement.
\item Elements are pushed in stack in reverse order.
\item The Part before the \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} symbol is iterated while top element of stack is not \textquotesingle{}\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}\textquotesingle{}. If top element of stack is \textquotesingle{}(\textquotesingle{} then store them in the leftpart string and pop it out from stack until the top element becomes \textquotesingle{})\textquotesingle{}, else just add top element of stack to left string and then pop it from stack.
\item We also need to check for multiple brackets if left part contains multiple brackets and has \textquotesingle{}\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}\textquotesingle{} symbol before the actual \textquotesingle{}\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}\textquotesingle{} so we count the number of opening brackets.
\item Now we remove \textquotesingle{}\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}\textquotesingle{} symbol
\item And similar to the left part string, we add elements to right part string until stack is empty.
\item Now match the left part of the implies statement with the statement given by {\ttfamily stringline\+Number2}.
\item We find the part of the given\+Left\+Part before the slash and make new\+Given\+Left\+Part string.
\item If leftpart obtained from implies statement is same as the new\+Given\+Left\+Part string and If result is same as right part, then true is returned and if any of above conditions fail, we return false. ~\newline

In this algorithm we are traversing once over all the elements present in the string so time complexity will be {\ttfamily O(n)}. \end{quote}

As we are making stack of size n so space complexity will be {\ttfamily O(n)}. \end{quote}
